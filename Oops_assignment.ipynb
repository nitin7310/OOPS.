        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that\n",
        "     organizes code into reusable and modular structures called \"objects.\" These objects represent real-world entities or concepts and combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template\n",
        "     for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of the objects, including their attributes (data) and methods (functions). A class encapsulates related variables and functions into a single entity, making it easier to create and manage objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "     A class serves as a blueprint, and the object is the specific realization of that blueprint. Think of a class as a cookie cutter, and the objects as the cookies made using it.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->1. Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "      Focus: Hides the implementation details and shows only the essential features or functionality of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Purpose: Simplifies complexity by providing a high-level overview of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "      How It's Achieved:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces (in languages that support them).\n",
        "\n",
        "      For example, an abstract method provides the \"what to do\" but not the \"how to do\".\n",
        "\n",
        "  2.Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "      Focus: Protects data by bundling it with the methods that operate on it, and restricts direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Purpose: Ensures data security and prevents unauthorized access or modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "      How It's Achieved:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Achieved by making attributes private (__attribute) and providing getter and setter methods to access and modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Encapsulation enforces controlled access to the internal state of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") in Python are\n",
        "        special methods that have double underscores (or \"dunders\") at the beginning and end of their names, such as __init__, __str__, and __add__. They are also known as magic methods or special methods and are used to define the behavior of objects and their interaction with built-in operations and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (called the child class or subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (called the parent class or base class). This enables code reuse, logical organization, and the ability to build more specific features on top of existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. The term \"polymorphism\" means \"many forms,\" and in programming, it refers to the ability of a single interface to represent different underlying data types or behaviors\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -> Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to an object's attributes (data) and allowing controlled access through methods. This is done by making attributes private and providing public methods (getters and setters) to interact with them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created. It is called automatically when an instance of a class is created and typically initializes the object's attributes to their default or provided values.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 1. Class Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "        Definition: A class method is a method that works with the class itself rather than an instance of the class. It is bound to the class and not the instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2.Static Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "       Definition: A static method is a method that does not depend on the class or an instance. It cannot modify or access class or instance-specific data and behaves like a regular function but belongs to a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Method overloading in general programming refers to the ability to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameter lists (e.g., differing in the number or type of arguments). However, Python does not natively support method overloading in the traditional sense because it allows only one method with a given name per class. If multiple methods with the same name are defined, the most recently defined one will overwrite the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concept where a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The overridden method in the child class has the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The property decorator in Python is a built-in feature that allows you to define methods that behave like attributes. This enables you to customize access to an attribute while keeping the syntax of accessing it simple and intuitive, just like accessing a regular attribute. It's primarily used for encapsulation and creating read-only or computed properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Polymorphism is a cornerstone of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enhances the flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of code. Its significance stems from its ability to allow objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. Hereâ€™s why polymorphism is so important\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes define a common interface and can include one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by derived (child) classes. They are often used to enforce a certain structure or behavior in subclasses, promoting consistency and code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This means a child class can derive attributes and methods from multiple base classes, enabling the reuse of functionality from multiple sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Method chaining in Python is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. It enables a more concise and readable coding style by linking method calls together, one after the other. For this to work, each method in the chain must return the same object (often by returning self).\n"
